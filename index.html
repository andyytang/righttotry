            <p>
                We are a group of high school sophomores from the Aurora region.
                Our groupâ€™s mission is to protect and advocate for those most
                vulnerable patients: terminally ill patients who have exhausted
                all avenues of treatment. Over the course of the past year, we
                have researched legislative options to expand compassionate use
                of experimental medicines. Below are some of our results.
            </p>

            <p>
                We wish to accomplish this by <strong>improving accessibility to
                medication</strong> and <strong>protecting these consumers from
                charlatans seeking to sell treatments with no benefit</strong>.
                One of the more recent bills focused on compassionate use of
                medication is the 2017 Senate Bill 204, known as the <em>Trickett
                Wendler Right to Try Act</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This activism was made for a project in the IMSA (Illinois
                Mathematics and Science Academy) LEAD (Leadership
                Education and Development) program. Specifically, this
                project was made for the ENACT (Enabling Activism) branch
                of LEAD.

            <blockquote>
                "AN ACT - To authorize the use of unapproved medical products
                by patients diagnosed with a terminal illness in accordance with
                State law, and for other purposes"

            <b>The Right to Try Act gives access to unapproved
                treatments if the patient fulfills the following:</b>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unable to participate in clinical trials.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exhausted conventional treatments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have a life-threatening or terminal illness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gives informed consent for the treatment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Drugs used must have passed Phase I (safety) FDA testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                This act was first passed in many states before making
                it to the federal levels. It allows terminally ill patients
                to use experimental drugs that have not yet been tested for
                effectiveness. This act is often contrasted with assisted
                dying: if a patient has the "right to die", they should also
                be allowed the right to try any medication that might have benefit.
            </p>

            <p>
                This legislation was passed without much incident until the final
                Senate vote, where opposition was expressed by certian interest
                groups. The FDA, who regulates drugs, expressed lukewarm approval,
                noting that they should be able to find ways to protect patients
                under this act. This legislation was mostly fronted by the Goldwater
                Institute, a libertarian think-tank, and it passed in several
                states before making it to the federal level.

            <h2>Policy Evaluation</h2>

            <h3>Effectiveness:</h3>

            <p>
                The Right to Try act does represent a forward
                step for awareness of this issue, and also
                attempts to streamline processes for Expanded
                Access (the old, FDA-based version of this law).
                However, this policy falls short in efficiency
                as well as ethics.
            </p>

            <h3>Efficiency:</h3>

            <p>
                A total of <b>two</b> patients, as of two years after
                the passing of the bill, recieved treatment: likely
                only because they were namesakes of the bill. While
                this has helped their lives immensely, such a small
                impact is caused by drug companies themselves: while
                the Right to Try Act targets the FDA as a roadblock
                to progress, drug companies are not obligated to give
                drugs to these patients.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethics:</h3>
            <p>
                The act's intent is commendable: it attempts to establish
                a policy to allow for compassionate use of experimental drugs.
                However, its implementation is problematic. First, it does
                not obligate drug companies to give experimental drugs, creating
                a false hope for many patients who have not yet been able to
                recieve aid.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, with only basic Phase I testing on
                a few patients, the act makes it more difficult to determine
                if the drug may be effective and safe, without adequate data.
                Loosening FDA oversight also causes more risk to patients:
                lessening their ability to stay informed of realistic potential
                benefits of the drug.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "container">
            <h2>Our Alternative</h2>
            <h3>Previous Alternatives:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Expanded Access:</b> This is an FDA program giving expanded
                    access to drugs through an application process. It is
                    similar to Right-to-Try, but involving FDA approval.
                    Throughout its use, there has been an overall 99% approval
                    rate, with the FDA recommending adjustments as necessary.
                    However, opponents argue that it is a bloated system
                    with no guarantee that most requests make it to the FDA for approval.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Compassionate Use Advisory Committees</b> are groups composed
                of bioethicists, physicians, and patient advocates who offer
                feedback on when and in what extents specific drugs ought
                to be made available to patients.

                This gives a more in-depth view of modern medicinal applications
                where patients could possibly benefit since they are well informed
                from multiple medical disciplines, without needing FDA approval.

                Drugs must have passed FDA Phase III drug testing, limiting the amount
                of drugs, but increasing drug effectiveness and data.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Alternative</h3>

            <p>
                Our alternative is a hybrid of <b>CompACs</b> as well as the
                previous <b>Expanded Access</b> system. Three things are
                key to the implementation of this alternative:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Drugs should have passed Phase II FDA, meaning that they
                    have shown some promise in terms of effectiveness while
                    being further tested for safety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application process should be streamlined through
                    the use of compassionate use advisory groups (CompACs)
                    to give patients information about drugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A representative from the drug producer, importantly,
                    should have a seat at the table, as this would ensure
                    that the patient is able to negotiate for the delivery
                    of such drug.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How You Can Help</h2>

            <p>
                In order to help enact the changes to our healthcare system and
                to improve its accessibility, we need your help in the process.
                It is impossible to implement such changes without the widespread
                support of the American people. So, we need your help to spread
                the message of reform and change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tell your friends and family, call your local representative,
                or organize groups to help educate people of this reformed
                system of experimental therapy. This is a fight to ensure
                that we are able to receive quality healthcare and to expand
                our choices. This is a fight to ensure that the government
                enacts a streamlined, safe process for drug selection. This
                is to protect those who are vulnerable. This is for you and me.
                So, join the good fight and help us spread the word.
